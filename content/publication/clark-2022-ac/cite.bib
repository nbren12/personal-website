 abstract = {Abstract Bretherton et al. (2022,
https://doi.org/10.1029/2021MS002794) demonstrated a successful
approach for using machine learning (ML) to help a
coarse-resolution global atmosphere model with real geography (a
?200 km version of NOAA's FV3GFS) evolve more like a
fine-resolution model, at the scales resolved by both. This
study extends that work for application in multiple climates and
multi-year ML-corrected simulations. Here four fine-resolution
(25 km) 2 year reference simulations are run using FV3GFS with
climatological sea surface temperatures perturbed uniformly by
-4, 0, +4, and +8 K. A data set of state-dependent corrective
tendencies is then derived through nudging the ?200 km model to
the coarsened state of the fine-resolution simulations in each
climate. Along with the surface radiative fluxes, the corrective
tendencies of temperature and specific humidity are
machine-learned as functions of the column state. ML predictions
for the fluxes and corrective tendencies are applied in 5.25
years ?200 km resolution simulations in each climate, and
improve the spatial pattern errors of land precipitation by
8%-28% and land surface temperature by 19%?25% across the
four climates. The ML has a neutral impact on the pattern error
of oceanic precipitation.},
