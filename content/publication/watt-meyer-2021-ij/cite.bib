 abstract = {Abstract Due to limited resolution and inaccurate physical
parameterizations, weather and climate models consistently
develop biases compared to the observed atmosphere. Using the
FV3GFS model at coarse resolution, we propose a method of
machine learning corrective tendencies from a hindcast
simulation nudged toward observational analysis. We show that a
random forest can predict the nudging tendencies from this
hindcast simulation with moderate skill using only the model
state as input. This random forest is then coupled to FV3GFS,
adding corrective tendencies of temperature, specific humidity
and horizontal winds at each timestep. The coupled model shows
no signs of instability in year-long simulations and has
significant reductions in short-term forecast error for 500 hPa
height, surface pressure and near-surface temperature.
Furthermore, the root mean square error of the annual-mean
precipitation is reduced by about 20%. Biases of other
variables remain similar or in some cases, like
upper-atmospheric temperature, increase in the year-long
simulations.},
