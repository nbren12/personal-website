 abstract = {Abstract Global atmospheric ?storm-resolving? models with
horizontal grid spacing of less than 5 km resolve deep cumulus
convection and flow in complex terrain. They promise to be
reference models that could be used to improve computationally
affordable coarse-grid global climate models across a range of
climates, reducing uncertainties in regional precipitation and
temperature trends. Here, machine learning of nudging tendencies
as functions of column state is used to correct the physical
parameterization tendencies of temperature, humidity, and
optionally winds, in a real-geography coarse-grid model (FV3GFS
with a 200 km grid) to be closer to those of a 40-day reference
simulation using X-SHiELD, a modified version of FV3GFS with a 3
km grid. Both simulations specify the same historical
sea-surface temperature fields. This methodology builds on a
prior study using a global observational analysis as the
reference. The coarse-grid model without machine learning
corrections has too few clouds, causing too much daytime heating
of land surfaces that creates excessive surface latent heat flux
and rainfall. This bias is avoided by learning downwelling
radiative flux from the fine-grid model. The best configuration
uses learned nudging tendencies for temperature and humidity but
not winds. Neural nets slightly outperform random forests.
Forecasts of 850 hPa temperature gain 18 hr of skill at 3?7 days
leads and time-mean precipitation patterns are improved 30% by
applying the ML correction. Adding machine-learned wind
tendencies improves 500 hPa height skill for the first five days
of forecasts but degrades time-mean upper tropospheric
temperature and zonal wind patterns thereafter.},
