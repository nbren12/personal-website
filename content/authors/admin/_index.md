Noah Brenowitz is the Senior Machine Learning Scientist for Climate Modeling at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. He is a Seattle native and attended the Bush School for high school. He completed a PhD in 2017 in Atmospheric-ocean Science and Mathematics at NYUâ€™s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences with Andrew Majda as his Advisor. While there he developed a strong background in applied mathematics. Since then he has focused on improving climate models with machine learning with Christopher Bretherton, first as a Moore/Sloan & WRF Innovation in Data Science Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Washington (UW) and then later as a Sr. Scientist at Vulcan. Noah has led the publication of several foundational papers in this burgeoning field. He enjoys spending his free-time in the beautiful mountains of the Pacific Northwest during all seasons of the year.


His Curriculum Vitae is available [here](files/cv.pdf).
