I use a lot of different software tools in the course of my research, so I need a way to keep track of them in case something destroys my computer. That is the purpose of this post.

# Python and python related tools

- Anaconda python distribution (version 3.5)
- Snakemake for managing scientific workflows

## Jupyter tools

- jupyter
- [nteract](https://github.com/nteract/nteract): for running notebooks on desktop
- [nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout): for removing output from ipython notebooks before commiting to a git repository.

# Text editing

- emacs with spacemacs

# Mac OS tools

- Alfred: a better version of the Mac OS spotlight application
- Spectacle: keyboard shortcuts for moving windows around.
